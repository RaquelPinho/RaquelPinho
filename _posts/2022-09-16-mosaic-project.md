## Description 

In this project, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting a porcine gene in zygotes using different delivery conditions. Cleavage efficiency, mutation frequency and off-target effects were analyzed, first with in vivo using blastocysts and parthenotes. We used PacBio sequencing to analyze, also mutation and mosaicism rate with amplicon deep sequencing.
