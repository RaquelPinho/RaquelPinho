## Description 

In this project, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting a porcine gene in zygotes for the production of a AR knock-out pig. Two different gRNAs were targeting the exon 1 of the gene, and cleavage efficiency, mutation frequency and off-target effects were analyzed, first with in vitro and in vivo approaches using blastocysts and parthenotes. Embryos and fetuses prevenient from failed pregnancies were also analyzed for the presence of mutation in the target site and probable off targets positions. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm reference sequences for target and off-target sites and mutations. CHANGE-seq was done in three wild-type pigs (two females and one male) for the genome wide analysis of off-target sites. The sites observed in the CHANGE-seq protocol will be sequenced in blastocysts, embryos and fetuses injected with the guides used in the study, using amplicon deep sequencing (rhAmpSeq).
