## Description 

Goat milk containing human lysozyme (hLZ) has shown beneficial effects on microbiome composition, gastro-intestinal (GI) morphology and the clinical condition of pigs. To explore the effect of hLZ milk on intestinal gene expression in malnourished animals, RNA-seq was conducted with tissue from the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of malnourished piglets fed with hLZ milk, regular goat milk or with no milk supplementation. Gene co-expression analysis and pheno- typic correlations were made with WGCNA, while integration of transcriptome with microbiota information and the hepatic metabolite profile was done using mixOmics.
