## Description 

Malnourishment is a risk factor for childhood mortality, jeopardizing the health of children by exacerbating diseases. Using a pig model of malnutrition, we analyzed the interplay between the phenotypic data displayed by the malnourished animals, the gene expression pattern along the intestinal tract, microbiota composition of the intestinal contents, and hepatic metabolite concentrations. Samples from the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of malnourished (protein and calorie-restricted diet) and full-fed (no dietary restrictions) piglets were subjected to RNA-seq. Gene co-expression analysis and phenotypic correlations were made with WGCNA, while the integration of transcriptome with microbiota composition and the hepatic metabolite profile was done using mixOmics. Malnourishment caused changes in tissue gene expression that influenced energetic balance, cell proliferation, nutrient absorption, and response to stress. Overall, changes in gene expression could explain several of the phenotypes displayed by malnourished animals and lays the foundation for further mechanistic and intervention studies.
