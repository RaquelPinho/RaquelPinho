# Welcome to Raquel Pinho Git page

In this webpage I will display the results of the RNAseq data and the Methylation analysis of the intestines of malnourished pigs fed with lyzozyme-rich milk. 

## RNAseq analysis 

The RNAseq analysis was made using both Salmon and Kallisto software for the read counts/ assignment. The differential expression analysis was done with both EdgeR (QLF-model) and DESeq2 (MLE), with the genes considered differently expressed being agreeing between the two models. The pathway analysis was done using DAVID and Reactome. the WGCNA  was also used for estimating network analysis between co-expressed genes.
